<p>This is a side project that I'm working on for fun. I took a Web Design course 
   back in the Spring of 2015 at Leeds University. I created a Food and Travel website 
   for my final project. I thought it would be nice to create my own website with a  
   domain that I purchased last year but haven't had the time to do so. This website
   is mostly just for me to speak aloud my thoughts and not for anyone in particular.</p>
<p>I'll try to update this as often as I can, but from past experience, I'm not very
   good at it. Designs will constantly change as I test out my HTML and CSS skills. :)</p>
